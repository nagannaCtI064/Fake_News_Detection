# Fake News Detection

## **Overview**
This project aims to detect whether a given news article is fake or real using a machine learning approach. The frontend is built with basic HTML and CSS, while the backend is developed using Flask. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is used to analyze and classify news articles.

## **Features**
- **Fake News Detection**: Utilizes a KNN classifier to determine if a news article is fake or real.
- **Data Processing**: Implements text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization to prepare the data for classification.
- **Frontend**: Simple and user-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS for inputting news articles and displaying results.
- **Backend**: Flask application handling data requests, preprocessing, and model predictions.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Flask
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript (if applicable)
- Scikit-learn (for KNN classifier)
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or similar libraries for text preprocessing
